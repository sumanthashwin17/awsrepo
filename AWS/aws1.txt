Types of applications 
======================
We have two types of applications.

1) Client based application 

2) Web based application


1) Client based application 
----------------------------
Application which is running in a user's computer is called client based application.

Application which need to be installed in a user's computer is called client based application.

All client based applications are ruled out.

ex:
	VLC Media Player 
	

2) Web based application
-----------------------
Application which can be access from anywhere over the network is called web based application.

ex:
	Facebook
	Gmail 
	and etc.


Q) How can we develop an application accessible by thousands of users?

Initially we need to develop the application and later we need to host that application on the top of the server.Then our application is ready to accessible by thousands of users.

Q) What is the difference between PC and Server?

PC						Server
------						-------
It is designed for perticular user.		It is designed to operate multiple users.

It contains simple structure.			It contains complex structure.

It contains less storage from gigabytes to 	It contains large storage from terabytes	
terabytes.					to petabytes.

Low network capability.				High network capability.

It contains single processor.			It contains multiple processors.



Q) Company will use one server or multiple servers?

Depends upon the scale of the company they use servers.

Companies revenue completely relay on servers.

Companies ensures that those servers are operating all the time.



To develop an application on top the server we need to create infrastructure.

Every IT company contains Data Center.

Data center is a place where we can host our servers.

Q) It is easy to create the data center?

It is not easy to establish the data center. 

Specially to start up's because it is a capital intensive.

To create a data center we required following things.

1) Secure and private place.

2) Required server maintaince team. 

3) Need Dual Network i.e ISP (Internet Service Provider)

4) Need Dual power supply.

5) Need to follow geographical standard to protect customer data physically and over the
   network.

6) Hardware refresh.

and etc.

To overcome above limitations cloud computing came into the picture.


Cloud computing 
===============
It is a on-demand delivery of IT resources over the network with pay-as-you-go model.

Cloud concept started from 2004.

We have following list of cloud providers.

ex:
	Provider		Cloud
	--------		---------
	Amazon			AWS  (Amazon Web Services)
	Google			GCP  (Google Cloud Platform)
	Microsoft		Azure
	IBM			IBM Cloud 
	Alibaba			Alibaba Cloud 
	and etc.		


AWS 
=====
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.

It is world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

It offers infrastructure as a service.

It was monopoly for 10 years and 80% of market is occupied by AWS.
