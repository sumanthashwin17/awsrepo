He has created linux kernel.

Kernel is a first layer of an operating system.

Linux kernel is a piece of software which interacts with hardware.

The main aspect of linux kernel are

EC2
====
EC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Compute.

It is a webservice offered by AWS to create virtual servers which are known as instances in cloud.

EC2 comes under IaaS (Infrastructure As a Service).

		username : centos
		password : DevOps321

step5:
------

-------
	login as : centos 

	Enter the password : DevOps321
