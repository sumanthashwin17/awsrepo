Types of Instances
==================
We have three types of instances in AWS.

1) Reserved Instances 

2) On-Demand Instances

3) Spot Instances


1) On-demand Instances:
----------------------
In this case  we are not ensure when we are going create server and terminate server.
On adopt basis , we are creating servers and terminating servers. 
Here billing is very high (> high) 


2) Reserved Instances : 
-----------------------
Whenever we have a vision to stay for a long term then we need to use reserved instance.

Typically when we joined a company, our company product manager or company representative talk to AWS TAM (Techical Account Manager).

ex:
	we will use 1000 cpu and 2TB memory for 3 years
	
	
3) Spot Instances  : 
-------------
	Here we will get 95% to 98% discount. 
	spot instance is gold in company.




AWS Tenancy 
===========
We have three types of AWS Tenancy.

1) Dedicated Host 

2) Dedicate instance 

3) Shared instance 


1) Shared instances : 
---------------------
Here amazon is not having any visibility on flipkart and vice versa.

	
> Dedicated instances :
------------------------
In dedicated instance , banks and insaurance companies don't want other 
servers should run in the harware where they are running.
It is costly to the company.

	
> Dedicated Hosts : 
---------------------
Applications which are developed on-premises need dedicated server like physical server of a data center.

It describes how much cpu and storage required . It specially designed for you.

It is also known as Bare Metal / Physical server.
